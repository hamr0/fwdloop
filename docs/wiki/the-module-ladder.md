# The module ladder

The modules in order, each with its scope, exit criteria and negative scenarios. Identity and
claims live in `PRD.md`; close mechanics in `how-a-step-closes.md`.

## The rule that binds this section

A module does not start until its **scope, exit and negative scenario** are written down and
signed. Modules run in order; never start N+1 while N is unproven. Every POC result updates the
PRD — a result that flips a claim is a spec change, not a footnote. A module works on its own,
then connects to what is built, before the next starts. **Never ship the POC**
(docs/archive/PRD.md:483-488). This is the fix for v0.5's drift (docs/archive/PRD.md:483-483).

## M0 — go/no-go, both claims

Two POCs, ordered: **M0a must pass before M0b starts** (docs/archive/PRD.md:493-493).

### M0a — scout, primitive selection, walkable chain

**SIGNED by hamr, 2026-09-12.** Exit met on DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (`deepseek-flash`); branch `m0a`
review-clean (9/9 findings fixed, each with a test proven to fail without its fix; security
review clean). Signing M0a proves Claim 2's first half only — it does not close go/no-go.

A bounded read-only scout looks at the fixtures first, its menu stripped of write and store
primitives by construction. The drafter then gets job #1 as prose plus guardrails, the scout's
facts, and the primitive catalogue, and emits steps carrying a **granted primitive list** and the
**artifact ids each step reads** — authoring no bodies and no plumbing. Steps share one artifact
space, fwdloop's stand-in for bareloop's tree. A deterministic validator proves the chain is
walkable (docs/archive/PRD.md:495-506).

- **Exit:** the chain is walkable end to end on the baseline model, and the validator names both
  primitives when it is not. **The scout's facts appear in the draft** — a column name in the
  declaration matches the fixture and was not invented (docs/archive/PRD.md:507-509).
- **Negative scenarios**, each of which must be able to fail (docs/archive/PRD.md:510-523):
  (i) reading an artifact no earlier step declared is a red naming step and artifact;
  (ii) a job line with no groundable check is refused at draft, never given a proxy check;
  (iii) a primitive not in the catalogue is a red, **never invented**;
  (iv) a primitive outside the signed skillset is a red even though it exists;
  (v) the scout attempting a write-class primitive is **impossible, not merely refused** — the verb
  is absent from its menu and a test proves the filtering;
  (vi) the **uncovered-line plant** — a prose line no guardrail covers must land at `hitl`, never at
  a green or an invented softgreen shape.
- **Kills the module:** the catalogue cannot express job #1 without a new primitive → upstream ask,
  and M0 stops until it is delivered (docs/archive/PRD.md:524-525).

**What M0 is actually asking:** *a job → its close → can the LLM form one → citations.* Primitive
selection is in M0a because a close cannot be formed without knowing what the step does; it is the
means, never the point. If a measurement forces a choice, **close formation wins**
(docs/archive/PRD.md:527-530).

### M0b — run it, close it

Execute M0a's declaration against job #1 using **only** baresuite primitives. Every step closes
under its declared class — green on the `derive` steps, softgreen on `compose`, hitl at the signed
`ask` — plus the mechanical *happened* check on all of them (docs/archive/PRD.md:532-536).

- **Exit:** the four plants reproduce on primitives — a wrong derived total reds naming the figure
  and formula; a wrong copied cell reds naming the cell; an ambiguous customer lands at an `ask` and
  never a pick; a clean run goes green through `send`. False reds 0. Both providers
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:537-541).
- **Negatives:** (i) a plant F5 caught on bespoke code must still red on primitives — one that goes
  green is the headline finding and a spec change; (ii) the **green-by-omission plant (F7)** — a
  reply missing the total and due date must red on the softgreen shape check; (iii) a step whose
  class is not declared is refused at validation, because the machine never picks a class
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:542-548).
- **Inputs:** both fixtures are frozen and hashed at job start and every step reads the frozen copy.
  An unreadable source or unwritable destination refuses by name, at $0, before any model call
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:550-552).

Numbers before firing: plants caught N/N, false reds 0/N, $ per run against the human cost, wall per
run, under a **$5 total** cap (docs/archive/PRD.md:554-555).

### PROPOSED AMENDMENT to M0b — unsigned, drafted 2026-09-12

Nothing below is in force until hamr signs it. It does not change M0b's exit above.

**A. The redo edge at an `ask`.** Today an `ask` has two outcomes: the human accepts and the run
moves on, or the run stops. This adds a third: the human **rejects**, and the run re-executes the
step the `ask` sits behind. Bound by three things the drafter cannot express or alter:

- **Cap: 3 redos per `ask`.** The 4th rejection halts the run and names the step. Human-signed,
  tighten-only, and inexpressible to the drafter — same class as the spend cap.
- **Reason required.** A rejection with no reason is refused at the `ask`; the run does not
  advance and does not redo. The reason is rubric-shaped free text ("this was wrong, should be
  more X") and is carried into the redo as an input to that step, so attempt N+1 differs from
  attempt N by something a human wrote.
- **Every attempt is recorded.** Each attempt's artifact, its rejection reason, and its cost land
  in `audit.jsonl`. A redo is not a retry that overwrites; it is a new attempt with a parent.

Rationale: without the reason, a redo re-runs the same step on the same inputs and burns the cap
producing the same artifact. The reason is the only thing that makes attempt 2 a different step.

**B. Job #2 — the resume/JD job, described cold by hamr.** Job #1 (AR-aging) remains M0b's exit,
unchanged. Job #2 is an **additional** run after M0b's exit is met, and is the first job whose
prose was written by hamr rather than by us. It is the only evidence Claim 2 has that is not in
our own words.

- Inputs, frozen and hashed at job start:
  `/home/hamr/Documents/resumes/Amr Hassan - Resume.docx`
  (sha256 3d6b24a881e5600e1dc2910cdcb11ce6e65c4f6d46c2238d74b4c7a7f7c5beab)
  `/home/hamr/Documents/resumes/jd-anthropic-applied-ai-architect.md`
  (sha256 7eaea1c00e8b7487f0ea5d910b33acd2fd32d354817bef80ec026b4b1fc12c00)
- Shape: read the resume; read the JD; write a summary under 600 words in three sections
  (story of experience / technical skills / soft skills), compared against the JD; `ask` — hamr
  accepts or rejects with a reason; on accept, write the summary to a document.
- Why it earns its place: it closes on **two** classes in one job — "under 600 words, three
  sections present" is a mechanical `softgreen` shape, and "is it any good" is a `hitl` — and it
  is the only job that exercises the redo edge in A.
- New code it requires: a `.docx` text reader. A `.docx` is a zip of XML; file-format knowledge
  is ours to write, not an upstream ask (F13). It is in M0b's scope only as an input reader and
  carries no stability promise.

**C. Stability numbers.** M0b's exit says "both providers" without a count. This sets one: **20
runs per scenario per provider, both on the same day**, bar declared before the runs at **19/20**.
Same-day/two-model separates "the shape works" from "we fitted to DeepSeek's habits"; it does not
detect a model changing under us, which the request-vs-served stamp (F22) covers instead.

## M1 — declaration spec, validator, hash

The grammar M0 proved, written down and mutation-tested: primitive catalogue as data, arbiter
fields inexpressible to the drafter, **`ask` positions as declared slots the drafter fills, never
steps it may add or omit** (F10: both providers wobbled on exactly this), ReDoS-safe patterns, and a
hash that flips on any edit (docs/archive/PRD.md:557-562).

- **Exit:** a mutation suite where every single-field corruption is caught, and a drafter cannot
  express an arbiter field in any position (docs/archive/PRD.md:563-564).
- **Negative:** a declaration missing a required `ask` slot is a red, not an absence
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:565-565).

## M2 — runner

A fold over steps with fresh context per step (artifacts, never transcripts), an effect check per
step, close by declared class, the ralph loop, `audit.jsonl` plus `history.jsonl`, money honesty and
the provider-red ladder (docs/archive/PRD.md:567-571).

**Load-bearing invariant:** the step executor is constructed **without its close and without the
cap** — goal in, gap back — and a test must prove the close is not reachable from the executor's
context (docs/archive/PRD.md:572-573).

- **Exit:** an arbitrary valid declaration runs, not job #1's shape hand-wired — v0.5's M0 could not
  do this, and that is logged as its scope limit (docs/archive/PRD.md:574-575).
- **Negative:** a step whose effect check fails halts the run and names the step
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:576-576).

## M3 — ask and inbox, the HITL window

The inbox and its answers, TTL, and checkpoint/resume at step level. A pause spends nothing, and a
resume never re-asks an answered question (docs/archive/PRD.md:578-581).

- **Exit:** a run pauses, a separate process answers, the run resumes into the next step
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:582-582).
- **Negative:** an expired TTL cancels; a rerun is a fresh engagement with its own counter
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:583-583).

## M4 — dry-run, accept, versions

Placed here because the UI's "edit and add turns" is meaningless without versioning. Dry-run
redirects egress to a file and changes nothing else — reads stay real. Accept signs a version hash,
any edit flips it and demands re-accept, and rollback restores a previous accepted version
(docs/archive/PRD.md:585-591).

- **Exit:** an edited flow refuses to run until re-accepted, and rollback restores a prior version
  whose cases still pass (docs/archive/PRD.md:592-593).
- **Negative:** a flow edited on disk without re-accept is a red naming the changed field, never a
  silent run of the new version (docs/archive/PRD.md:594-595).

## M5 — localhost UI, the crux

Ruled the crux of the product, where humans author, run, describe and observe — so it moves here
from last, and every module after it ships its screen (docs/archive/PRD.md:597-600).

Scope: describe a job in prose plus guardrails and see the drafted steps; run it; watch it; the
inbox and its three doors; `audit <run>` as a readable table with the citation trail; and **edit an
existing workflow and add turns to it**, which re-signs through M4. Responsive and phone-tested per
AGENT_RULES — this is not a POC (docs/archive/PRD.md:601-605).

- **Exit:** a person who has never used the CLI can describe job #1, sign it, run it, answer its ask,
  and read why a red was red — without opening a terminal (docs/archive/PRD.md:606-607).
- **Negative:** a wrong number is traceable to its source cell in one screen; if it is not, the audit
  is a log and not a product feature, and that is a spec change (docs/archive/PRD.md:608-609).

## M6 — skills and persona

Skill directories gate the drafter's visible primitive subset, and a signed persona line affects
`compose` wording only. Menu-is-inventory: a checkbox with no skill directory is a validation red
(docs/archive/PRD.md:611-614).

- **Exit:** the drafter cannot select a primitive its signed skillset does not unlock
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:615-615).
- **Negative:** persona changes wording and never a cited figure (docs/archive/PRD.md:616-616).

## M7 — case library and maintenance mode

A `cases/<id>/` directory per flow; every human-resolved red becomes a case, re-run on every edit
and every model or provider change, with the incident loop detect → diagnose → contain → extend
(docs/archive/PRD.md:617-620).

- **Exit:** a model swap that breaks a case is refused at accept, naming the case
  (docs/archive/PRD.md:621-621).

## M8 — triggers and flow handover

`manual`, `cron`, `file-drop`, then `inbox-poll`. Flow-to-flow handover rides `file-drop`, and the
monthly wall is enforced **by the trigger**, before a run starts.

- **Exit:** a trigger refuses to fire when the month cannot fund a whole run, recording
  `monthly-exhausted` rather than starting and halting mid-way.

## M9 — real IO

Mail in and out, chat, browse — each behind the signed allow-list and a prior `ask` accept in the
same run. Scope is stated when its turn comes.
